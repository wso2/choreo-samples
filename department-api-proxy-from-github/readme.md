# Department API Proxy from GitHub Repository

## Use case

This sample demonstrates how to create a proxy for a Department API using a GitHub repository. The API Proxy component will forward requests to the actual Department API, allowing you to manage and monitor the API traffic.

The Department API provides endpoints to manage department information. By creating a proxy for this API, you can add additional layers of security, rate limiting, and analytics.

The following steps will guide you through the process of creating and deploying the Department API Proxy component in Choreo:

1. **Create the API Proxy**: Create the API Proxy using the provided sample values.
2. **Configure and Deploy the API Proxy**: Configure the necessary settings and deploy the API proxy to make it available for use.
4. **Test the API Proxy**: Use the OpenAPI Console in Choreo to test the API Proxy and ensure it is functioning correctly.
