        - `imageUrl`: The Docker image URL is **mandatory** for quick deployable samples, and the image must be hosted in the `choreoanonymouspullable.azurecr.io` registry.
    - Ensure the following additional files are included, depending on the component type
        - For **services**, include a `endpoints.yaml` file in the `/.choreo` directory of the component.
